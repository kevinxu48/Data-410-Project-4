# Comparison of Repeated Boosting Algorithms With LightGBM

## Multiple Boosting
In this project, we will update the algorithms created in Project 3, to implement repeated boosting. Compare with more boosting algorithms such as LightGBM

# Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) Regressor
LightGBM is an open source gradient boosting algorithm proposed and developed by Microsoft. Compared to XGBoost which grows Decision Trees based on a pre-sort-based algorithms, LightGBM instead uses histogram-based algorithms. In this project we will implement the LightGBM regressor. The LightGBM algorithm utilizes two techniques called Gradient-Based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB) which allow the algorithm to run faster while maintaining a high level of accuracy
